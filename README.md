> A Complete Overhaul to Minecraft's Fishing Mechanics!

 BetterFish brings the joy back into fishing. Minecraft's vanilla mechanics are rather bland. There are only 4 fish varients and a handful of different treasures you can find. BetterFish allows you to add near limitless numbers of fish and fishing rods using resource packs to ensure your players will have a completely different view on fishing.
